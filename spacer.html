            <p2>
                In this concept I bring together a tangram puzzle and a journal haven. 
                The idea is to explore space and itâ€™s constellations, each constellation is 1 Puzzle,
                and 1 Day in the game. There are stories for each puzzle,
                 reading them is optional, and so is the journal.  
            </p2>

                <h4>Inspired by therapeutic practices.</h4>
                <p2>A cognitive selection of few actions, to help bring focus and clarity. 
                    Reading, 
                    writing and solving small puzzles can help regulate the nervous system. </p2>

                <h4>Trying to cater a need.</h4>
                <p2>SPACER is designed for players who are looking for games and apps that allow them to relax before bedtime, 
                    or to release stress during the day. They do that by playing games or using social apps. 
                    Many are experiencing information overload, addictive or automated behaviours and often end up with 
                    more stimulation and even less peace of mind. </p2>
                <h4>Main goal.</h4>
                <p2>Help users deal with stress by playing a game that helps quiet the mind, 
                    easing into bedtime or to relax during the day. Testing the combination of short stories, 
                    game levels of Tangram-like puzzles and a section for Journaling. </p2>
