            <h4>About</h4>
            <p2>
                Mor Halperin is an Artist and a Psychology student (with an Art History minor).<br>Through the years Mor had learned several crafts and studies like Classic Animation, Illustration,
                Traditional Goldsmithing and casting.<br><br> The path is at times unclear, with lots of experimentation of different meduims over the years, including jewelery making, lost-wax casting, oil painting, digital art and design, 
                making game jams and learning how to code and creat art for games.<br><br>

                Three years ago, moving to Finland had a great impact on her artistic direction and she was inspired to persue both practices, the traditional art making, next to the digital one.
                With her current studies, she plans to make use of along art and expression, to help others.<br><br>

                She had exhibited her paintings in galleries in Helsinki, with her first Solo Exhibition at Cerma coming next year in August, 2024.<br><br>

                As a painter her artistic path is that of channeling comfort, itenral faith, passion, freedom, curiosity, and playfullness.
                Mor's influences range from wild animals and expressive naturalistic themes to serene and naive scenes, depicting styles from rustic to whimsical.
